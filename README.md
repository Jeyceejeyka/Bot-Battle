# Bot Manager App

## Overview
The **Bot Manager App** is a React-based application for managing a collection of bots. Users can view bots, sort and filter them by class or attributes, enlist bots into their army, release them, or discharge them permanently.

This project uses modern React features like hooks, components, and a responsive design implemented with a Bento-style grid layout. The app also integrates with a backend API for fetching, adding, and deleting bot data.

## Features
- **Bot Collection**: Displays a list of bots fetched from the backend.
- **Your Bot Army**: Manage enlisted bots with options to release or discharge them.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Sort bots by health, damage, or armor and filter by class.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-friendly interface using a Bento-style grid layout.
